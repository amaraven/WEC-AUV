# WEC-AUV
This MATLAB codebase simulates power dynamics between a Wave Energy Converter (WEC), a central energy storage unit, and a fleet of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle(s) (AUV(s)). It is designed to help users evaluate component compatability and aid in system optimization. The model simulates power exchanges to inform hardware recommendations.
